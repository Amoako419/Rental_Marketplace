# Rental Marketplace

Overview
========

This project focuses on implementing an end-to-end data pipeline for a rental marketplace platform, similar to Airbnb. The pipeline extracts data from an AWS Aurora MySQL database, processes it, and loads it into an Amazon Redshift data warehouse. The platform's data includes rental listings and user interactions, enabling analytical reporting and business intelligence. The pipeline ensures data validation, transformation, and efficient loading into Redshift to support reporting and decision-making processes.
