# Rental Marketplace

Overview
========

This project focuses on implementing an end-to-end data pipeline for a rental marketplace platform, similar to Airbnb. The pipeline extracts data from an AWS Aurora MySQL database, processes it, and loads it into an Amazon Redshift data warehouse. The platform's data includes rental listings and user interactions, enabling analytical reporting and business intelligence. The pipeline ensures data validation, transformation, and efficient loading into Redshift to support reporting and decision-making processes.

## üìä Monthly KPI Analysis

### SQL Query
The following query retrieves key performance indicators (KPIs) for monthly analysis:

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/Monthly-kpis.png" alt="The monthly kpis" width="100%" />
</p>

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
    o.month,
    o.occupancy_rate,
    d.avg_booking_duration
FROM presentation.kpis.occupancy_rate_per_month o
LEFT JOIN presentation.kpis.avg_booking_duration d
    ON o.month = d.month
ORDER BY o.month;
```

### Explanation for the CEO (Monthly KPIs)

- **Occupancy Rate**:  
  This metric shows the percentage of available rental nights that were booked in a month, indicating how effectively our inventory is being utilized.

- **Average Booking Duration**:  
  By tracking the average length of stays, we gain insight into customer preferences and the potential revenue per booking.

### SQL Query
The following query retrieves key performance indicators (KPIs) for weekly analysis:

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/weekly-kpis.png" alt="The weekly kpis" width="100%" />
</p>

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
    a.week_start,
    a.avg_listing_price,
    l.cityname,
    l.total_bookings AS popular_city_bookings,
    u.total_bookings AS user_total_bookings
FROM presentation.kpis.avg_listing_price_per_week a
LEFT JOIN presentation.kpis.most_popular_locations l
    ON a.week_start = l.week
LEFT JOIN presentation.kpis.total_bookings_per_user u
    ON a.week_start = u.week
ORDER BY u.total_bookings DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### Explanation for the CEO (Weekly KPIs)

- **Average Listing Price**:  
  We monitor the average rental price of active listings each week. This provides insight into market pricing trends.

- **Most Popular Location**:  
  For each week, we identify the city with the highest number of bookings. This helps us target marketing and adjust inventory for high-demand areas.

- **User Engagement**:  
  We also track the total number of bookings per user each week. Higher numbers indicate increased engagement and platform stickiness.
